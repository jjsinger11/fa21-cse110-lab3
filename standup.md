What did we do yesterday:
We recently planned to have a surfing trip and we were going over the logistics of the trip. We previously met with out group members, but we're still not sure how many will be attending the actual trip. 

What are we doing today:
Today, we will be deciding where we are going and what gear we will need to bring. We want a rough idea of how many people are coming as well as when we will be leaving for the trip.

Issues:
We need to book rooms ASAP, so we will have to cutoff when people can continue to join the group. We also need to make sure the weather is good for our trip so we can have GREAT surf!
